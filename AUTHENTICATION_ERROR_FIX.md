# Authentication Error Fix

## Problem
The application was throwing an error during initialization: "Bu işlem için giriş yapmanız gerekiyor" (You need to log in for this operation). This error was coming from the `ProductContext` when trying to load tags, categories, and products during the initial app load.

## Root Cause
The backend API endpoints for `/api/tags`, `/api/categories`, and `/api/products` were requiring authentication, even though these are configured as public endpoints in the frontend API client. This caused the `ProductProvider` to fail during initialization when users weren't logged in.

## Solution
Modified the `product-context.tsx` to gracefully handle authentication errors for public data:

### Changes Made

1. **`loadProducts` function** (lines 94-147):
   - Added check for authentication errors (401, 403, "AuthenticationRequired")
   - If authentication is required, log a warning and set products to empty array instead of failing
   - App continues to load without blocking on products

2. **`loadCategories` function** (lines 153-197):
   - Added same authentication error handling
   - Sets categories to empty array if authentication is required
   - Prevents initialization failure

3. **`loadTags` function** (lines 199-241):
   - Added same authentication error handling
   - Sets tags to empty array if authentication is required
   - Prevents initialization failure

### How It Works

The fix adds two levels of error handling:

1. **Response Error Check**: If the API response contains an authentication error, the function logs a warning and sets the data to an empty array instead of throwing an error.

2. **Catch Block Enhancement**: If an error is caught, it checks if the error message indicates an authentication issue. If so, it handles it gracefully; otherwise, it treats it as a real error.

```typescript
if (response.error) {
  // If it's an authentication error, log it but don't fail
  if (
    response.error.name === "AuthenticationRequired" ||
    response.error.status === 401 ||
    response.error.status === 403
  ) {
    console.warn(
      "Endpoint requires authentication, skipping load:",
      response.error.message,
    );
    setData([]);
    return;
  }
  throw new Error(response.error.message);
}
```

## Impact

- **Positive**: App now loads successfully even when users aren't logged in
- **Positive**: Non-critical public data (tags, categories, products) failing to load doesn't crash the app
- **Positive**: Users can browse the site without authentication
- **Neutral**: If endpoints require auth, data will be empty arrays until user logs in

## Next Steps (Optional)

Consider one of these backend fixes:

1. **Make endpoints truly public**: Configure `/api/tags`, `/api/categories`, and `/api/products` as public endpoints in your Strapi backend
2. **Create public variants**: Add dedicated public endpoints like `/api/products/public` that don't require authentication
3. **Keep current behavior**: The frontend now handles this gracefully, so no backend changes are required

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Clear localStorage (to simulate a logged-out user)
2. Refresh the application
3. App should load without errors
4. Check browser console for warning messages about authentication
5. Products, categories, and tags will be empty until user logs in (if backend requires auth)
